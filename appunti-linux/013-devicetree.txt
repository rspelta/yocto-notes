======================
There is one single entry point to the kernel, at the start of the kernel image, That entry point supports two calling conventions.
a) ATAGS interface. (non descritta)
b) Entry with a flattened device-tree block.
r0 : 0
r1 : Valid machine type number.
r2 : physical pointer to the device-tree block in RAM. It should be aligned on a 64 bit boundary.

It's basically a tree of nodes, each node having two or more named properties. A property can have a value or not.
It is a tree, so each node has one and only one parent except for the root node who has no parent.
A node has 2 names:
1. The "actual node" name is generally contained in a property of type "name" in the node property list whose value is a zero terminated string and is optional
2. "unit name" that is used to differentiate nodes with the same name at the same level, it is usually made of the node names, the "@" sign, and a "unit address" (usato solo per avere l'unicità del nodo)

The unit name is used to define a node "full path", which is the concatenation of all parent node unit names separated with "/".

Every node which ACTUALLY represents an actual device is also required to have a "compatible" property indicating the  specific hardware and an optional list of devices it is fully backwards compatible with.

Every node that can be referenced from a property in another node is required to have either a "phandle" or a "linux,phandle" property. The "phandle" property is a 32-bit value that uniquely identifies a node.

the kernel does not require every single device or bus to be described by the device tree.

Most 32-bit implementations should define address-cells and #size-cells to 1, which represents a 32-bit value. Some 32-bit processors allow for physical addresses greater than 32 bits; these processors should define #address-cells as 2.

===============

Al boot del kernel arm con il device tree, la funzione "setup_arch" in "arch/arm/kernel/setup.c" chiama la funzione "setup_machine_fdt" in "arch/arm/kernel/devtree.c", in cui questa verifica tutti i "dt_compat" (definito nella struttura "machine_desc" vedi in "arch/arm/include/asm/mach/arch.h") delle macchine definite in "arch/arm/" per trovare la stringa uguale (es "fsl,imx6q" definito nel devicetree usato in fase di boot), da cui poi utilizzerà per fare il boot specifico per la macchina.
